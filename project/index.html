            <h2>By Tatsuya Endo</h2>
            <p>
                The countries of Westalis and Ostania are locked in a cold war rife with espionage and assassination.
                After flawlessly completing yet another mission, Westalis's top agent, the master spy known only as
                Twilight, has been tasked with investigating the activities of Donovan Desmond, leader of Ostania's
                far-right National Unity Party. The problem is that Desmond is a social hermit and only ever makes
                public appearances at his sons' school functions. Thus Twilight has been ordered to get close to
                Desmond... by getting married and having a child. Oh, and he has seven days to find that family.
                <br><br>
                Assuming the identity of psychiatrist Loid Forger, Twilight recruits Anya and Yor Briar to play the part
                of his daughter and wife. Making things more complicated, however, is that Anya and Yor are keeping
                secrets of their own:
                Anya is a telepath and Yor is an assassin code named Thorn Princess, who needs a husband to avoid
                societal scrutiny in socially-conservative Ostania.
                <br><br>
                Thus begins Loid, Anya, and Yor's attempts to pretend to be the best family they can, all while hiding
                their secret identities from the others... and trying to ignore the growing signs that they're not just
                pretending.
            </p>
